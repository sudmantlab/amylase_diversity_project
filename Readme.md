- Davide
    - TRIED
        - Davide tried clustering
        - didn't help THAT much
        - evaluation with removing bad samples
        - 76% on the first one diploype prediction accuracy, and 100%  a
            - without any clustering!
        - cluster 90% similar
        - can try 80%?
    - will do
        - show prediction as a function of clustering
            - slide DBscan cutoff / clustering cutoff
        - use DBscan but remove the "[].0/[].1"
        - make a reduced copy number of bundles vector to predict
        - show some examples of what's different
- Alessandro
    - UKBIobank HAS the intensities!
    - Spoke w/ Nicola Perastou (sp?) about multiple testing correction
    - downloaded summary stats for 2-3 phenotypes gluten intake and glucose 
    - could we try looking at ALL phenotypes and 
    - will do
        - look into looking at associateion of 20 SNPs w/ ALL phenotypes (or a subset)
        - look into GWAS of 2-3 phenotypes across that locus
        - Compare intensity of 1kg genotypes over that locus with genotypes (intersect the OMNI with UKBB)

- Andrea look into trying to run VERKKO ?
- Peter make the final set of haplotypes, no broken haps! EXCLUDE THOSE
- Peter Alma Nicolas figgs
