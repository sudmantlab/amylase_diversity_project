## To Do (Erik/Davide/Alessandro)

- explore pangenome of the AMY region on the HPRC and extract multi-fasta with all the haplotypes - done on this Snakemake pipeline [here](https://github.com/sudmantlab/amylase_diversity_project/tree/main/pangenome/exploratory_copy_number) 
- representation of AMY region with [gfeastus](https://github.com/chfi/gfaestus)
- align short reads on the extracted fasta (in progress)
