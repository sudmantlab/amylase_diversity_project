# PGRTK pangenome graph construction

PGRTK graphs and principal bundle decompositions found [here](https://github.com/sudmantlab/amylase_diversity_project/tree/main/HPRC_AMY_Sequences/combined_y1_y2_analyses/output/pgrtk)

Haplotype assignments found [here](https://github.com/sudmantlab/amylase_diversity_project/blob/main/HPRC_AMY_Sequences/combined_y1_y2_analyses/output/haplotype_assignments.txt)

Principal bundle sequences (e.g. `0.0-3.0-7.0-4.0-8.0-5.0-6.0-2.0-4.1-7.1-2.1-5.0-6.0-2.0-4.1-7.1-2.1-5.0-6.0-2.0-1.0`) are encoded as bundle identities separated by hyphens. 
Each bundle (indicated by a number) is referred to by its identifier (a number) followed by a `.` and then a 0 or 1 indicating it's orientation (direct or inverted respectively).
